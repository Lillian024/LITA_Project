### Project Overview
---
The Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E-commerce project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data recieved, we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decision which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from data.

### Data Sources
---
The Primary source of Data used here is Data Sales.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle or FRED or any other data respository site.

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Data Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization
     
- SQL (Structured Query Language) for Querying of Data

### Data Cleaning and Preparations

In the initial phase of the Data Cleaning and Preparations, we perform the following actions;

### Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Analysis

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
